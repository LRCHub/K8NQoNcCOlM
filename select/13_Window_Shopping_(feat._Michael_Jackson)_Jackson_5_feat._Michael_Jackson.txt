I was window shopping, window shopping
Never meant to buy
Just touch and try
You sold me, control me
I was window shopping, window shopping
Never meant to buy
Just touch and try

I thought I had my game up tight
But with you I couldn't play it right
I pretended to be ice cold
But inside my temperature rose, oh yeah

Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
I tried and I tried but I can't resist

I was window shopping, window shopping
Never meant to buy
Just touch and try
You sold me, control me
I was window shopping, window shopping
Never meant to buy
Just touch and try

To think that I once boasted around
No ones arms could ever tie me down
But you've changed my point of view
And now I'm trying to tie a knot onto you, oh baby

Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
I was the seller, not the buyer until I met you

I was window shopping, window shopping
Never meant to buy
Just touch and try
You sold me, control me
I was window shopping, window shopping
Never meant to buy
Just touch and try

You're priceless merchandise
You're precious merchandise
You sold me, control me

I was window shopping, window shopping
Never meant to buy
Just touch and try
Come on...

I was window shopping, window shopping
Never meant to buy
Just touch and try
Come on...

I was window shopping, window shopping
Never meant to buy
Just touch and try
Come on...
