Intuition tells me
About the kind of clothes I should wear
But intuition won't help me
To become a self made millionaire

There's always someone on the phone
Getting stupid undone
Wants to know what can't be go
I don't care

Never say your sorry
Let science turn your head
Cos when you start to worry
Then you're better off being dead

Intuition tells me
Of the ways I can cut my hair
But intuition can't help me
Because it's seldom there
