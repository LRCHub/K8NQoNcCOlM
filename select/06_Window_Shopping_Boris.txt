Hold me my sweet
Hold me love
Hold me god
And I shout
The sound for the soul
A portal
I travel through time
All my senses burn
The portal can learn
The portal can burn
Hold me
Hold me
Hold...

All the leaves are brown (All the leaves are brown)
And the sky is grey (And the sky is grey)
I've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day (On a winter's day)
I'd be safe and warm (I'd be safe and warm)
If I was in L.A. (If I was in L.A.)

California dreaming (California dreaming)
On such a winter's day...

All the leaves are brown (All the leaves are brown)
And the sky is grey (And the sky is grey)
I've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day (On a winter's day)
I'd be safe and warm (I'd be safe and warm)
If I was in L.A. (If I was in L.A.)

California dreaming (California dreaming)
On such a winter's day...

Hold me my sweet
Hold me love
Hold me god
Hold me
Hold...
