Feeling your way now
At times you close your eyes
It makes a difference
It makes the moving difficult
When you're not around

I'd never cross that line
I still want to show you
I want to change your mind
Something that we could be

Something you won't try
You lost we tried to get inside
Window shopping
I just want to show you
I just can't relate
